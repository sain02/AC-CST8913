# LAB 1- Migration Requirement Gathering
# Sayvant Cloud Migration Plan 

## Motivators
- Clinicians spend ~20% of their time on manual charting.  
- Documentation burden causes burnout and discharge delays.  
- Need secure, scalable AI-driven documentation in 30+ languages.  
- Leverage Azure OpenAI Service for efficiency and compliance.  

## Key Questions
- What workflows are most time-consuming?  
- What performance targets (charting time, discharge speed) are required?  
- What compliance standards apply (HIPAA, SOC 2)?  
- What scalability is needed (multi-tenant, GPU infrastructure)?  
- How will clinician feedback guide adoption?  

## RACI (Summary)
- **CEO/Founders** – Accountable for strategy.  
- **Engineering Team** – Responsible for Azure deployment.  
- **Security Lead** – Accountable for HIPAA/SOC 2 compliance.  
- **Clinical Product Team** – Responsible for testing & feedback.  
- **Project Manager** – Coordinates rollout and timelines.  
- **Clinicians** – Informed and engaged via UAT.  

## Migration Approach

1. **Build** – Deploy secure, GPU-backed Azure infrastructure.  
2. **Rollout** – Expand to 70+ sites within 9 months.  
3. **Optimize** – Cut charting to <90 sec, reduce delays by 40%.  
4. **Scale** – Expand features and language support.  

## Schedule
- **Weeks 1–2:** Workflow analysis.  
- **Weeks 3–5:** Build/test Azure environment.   
- **Months 4–6:** Rollout to sites.  
- **Months 6+:** Optimize and scale.  

## Decision Criteria
- Efficiency: Charting <90 seconds, 10x adoption.  
- Compliance: HIPAA & SOC 2.  
- Scalability: Multi-tenant, GPU support.  
- User Experience: High clinician satisfaction.  
- Impact: ~40% fewer discharge delays.
